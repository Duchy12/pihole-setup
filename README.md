# pihole-setup

## Install
```
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Duchy12/pihole-setup/main/setup.sh | bash
```

## NOTE
- Health status has been removed due to the fact that it was sometimes finnicky and wouldn't work properly. I will be looking into a better way to implement this in the future.
- The install script will now automatically install the latest version of Pi-hole docker image.
